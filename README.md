# ‚úÖ Auto Cloud Backup System


## üìñ Project Overview

The **Automated Cloud Backup System** is a robust solution designed to securely back up critical files and databases from local servers or EC2 instances to **AWS S3**. The system ensures data protection through versioning, lifecycle management, automated scheduling, and real-time notifications using AWS services.

This project is ideal for **Cloud Administrator Interns**, DevOps engineers, or anyone interested in implementing reliable cloud-based backup solutions with minimal manual intervention.

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BEASTTech/Automated-Cloud-Backup-System.git
cd Automated-Cloud-Backup-System
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure AWS Credentials

Set your AWS credentials using environment variables or a `.env` file:

Example `.env` file:

```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=your_region
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
TO_EMAIL=notify_email@example.com
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Update Configuration

In `cloud_backup.py`, update the following parameters:

```python
local_backup_folder = "/path/to/your/data"
bucket_name = "your-s3-bucket-name"
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Backup Script

Run the script manually to ensure it's working:

```bash
python cloud_backup.py
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Schedule Backups with Cron

Use the `cron_setup.txt` example to set up automated daily backups:

```bash
0 2 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/Automated-Cloud-Backup-System/cloud_backup.py
```

This schedules the backup to run every day at 2 AM.

### üìÇ Folder for Logs

The `logs/` directory stores backup logs. Ensure this folder exists and has appropriate permissions:

```bash
mkdir logs
chmod 755 logs
```

## üìä Architecture Diagram

The diagram below illustrates the flow of the system:

<img src="https://github.com/parthdummy/icons-main/blob/main/Diagram.png" width="500px">

**Flow Overview:**

1. Data from the Local Server or EC2 is picked up by the Backup Script.
2. Files are uploaded to AWS S3 with versioning enabled.
3. Lifecycle rules transfer old backups to AWS Glacier for cost savings.
4. AWS CloudWatch monitors performance and logs.
5. AWS SNS sends real-time notifications to email or Slack.

## üì• Example .env Template

Create a file named `.env` in your project folder and paste the following:

```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=your_region
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
TO_EMAIL=notify_email@example.com
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual AWS credentials and notification settings.

## ‚úÖ Usage Tips

‚úî Use environment variables to store sensitive information.  
‚úî Test the backup process manually before scheduling.  
‚úî Monitor logs regularly to ensure backups are running smoothly.  
‚úî Enable lifecycle rules in S3 to reduce storage costs.  
‚úî Use CloudWatch dashboards to track performance and error alerts.

## üìÇ Future Enhancements

‚úî Support for multiple AWS regions  
‚úî Encrypted backups with AWS KMS  
‚úî Integration with Slack for notifications  
‚úî GUI dashboard for easier management  
‚úî Containerization with Docker for portability
